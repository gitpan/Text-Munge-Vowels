NAME

    Text::Munge::Vowels - removes vowels from words phrases

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Munge::Vowels;

        $obj = new Text::Munge::Vowels();
        $obj->add_stopwords LIST

        $string = $obj->munge LIST

DESCRIPTION

    Text::Munge::Vowels strips vowels spaces from words and phrases
    to shorten the length of simple text messages, as might be used
    for to send weather forecasts or short news items to
    alphanumeric pagers with limited message or screen sizes.

    Note that there's another module on CPAN called Lingua-EN-Squeeze
    intended for the same purpose.

EXAMPLE

        use Text::Munge::Vowels();

        $munger = new Text::Munge::Vowels();

        $text = "This sentence will have some of it\'s vowels removed.";

        print $munger->munge($text), "\n";

CAVEATS

    Overuse can make messages unreadable. "Decoding" the output of
    this module requires a human (?) brain familiar with the
    language and the context of the messages.

    Some would argue the use of this module is suspect.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

    Improve the regular expression in *$DefaultMungeRule* to ignore
    double or triple vowels in short words.

    Actually, I am working on a separate module which will load
    specialized vocabularies from XML files. If this module evolves
    at all, it will be as a wrapper to that module.
